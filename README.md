# Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project implements the key ideas from Yann LeCun's paper *Handwritten Digit Recognition with a Back-Propagation Network*.

## Project Structure
- `main.py`: Main entry point to load data, train models, and make predictions.
- `data_loader.py`: Handles loading and splitting of the dataset.
- `model.py`: Contains different models (KNN and CNN).
- `image_utils.py`: Utility functions for image display and handling.

## Future Improvements
- Implementing CNN (LeNet) for better accuracy.
- Testing with custom handwritten images.
